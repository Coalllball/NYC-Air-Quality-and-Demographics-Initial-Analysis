## Relationship between NYC Air Quality and Demographic


This initial analysis provides insight into the correlation between air quality and demographics in New York City, particularly at the borough and community levels. In general, air pollutant levels have been declining over the years. With a focus on three major air pollutants (NO2, PM 2.5, and ozone) and demographic factors including age and racial composition, we looked closely at dependency ratios, ethnicity ratios, population densities, and overall demographic trends among different age groups. At the borough level, 
our investigation highlighted general patterns in pollutant distribution, revealing potential positive correlations between transportation activity (especially vehicle miles traveled) and pollutants such as PM 2.5 and nitrogen dioxide. At the core of our investigation are community-level data that show regions with higher levels of Ozone tend to overlap with areas with large Asian populations, especially those with large elderly populations. These findings highlight living conditions in these areas that require further consideration. Supported by a series of maps and plots, these insights point to potential avenues for more in-depth investigation in these datasets and in this research area
